Exe is located with some dlls, make sure to run the exe with the dlls in the same folder
While running the exe, you should see 2 things

1) the console window
2) the maze window

----program should be run on 1080p displays----
DO NOT TOUCH THE MAZE WINDOW, IT WILL FREEZE.

the console window is just a command prompt.
**The issue is, that in windows 11, the old command prompt was replaced
by the new "terminal"**
**skip to last paragraph for an important instruction**

our code, moves the maze window to the right, which is successful in both win 10/11.

The console window however, cant move. Since win 11 introduced their new terminal,
resizing/moving the terminal does not work.
This problem is well known, check this link for more info:
https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/5094

It was intended that the terminal be moved to the left. Our code works on win 10.
-> see main() line 1.

Therefore, if you are running win11, please note that the terminal is NOT resized or moved.
When running the program, make sure TO NOT TOUCH THE MAZE.
***The non-resized terminal makes touching the maze more probable.****
