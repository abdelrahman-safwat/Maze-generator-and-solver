# Maze Generator and Solver

Breifly, the project generates a maze and solves it. Demo gif is shown below. The user first chooses the maze size (it is always a square maze), then the maze is generated. After that the user can pick the solving algorithm of his choice. The maze always starts at the top left corner and ends at the bottom right corner.

The project utilizes graph traversal and shortest path Algorithms, namely DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and A* with L2-norm heuristic. The library used for the GUI is SFML. Every single element drawn on screen is a rectangle, it is all rectangle manipulations in SFML.

Check the documentation pdf for details about the GUI, block layout, color structure, generation, ...etc
